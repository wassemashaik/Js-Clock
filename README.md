# JavaScript Analog Clock 🕒

This is a simple analog clock built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time using rotating hands for hours, minutes, and seconds.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time updates using `setInterval`
- Smooth rotation of clock hands
- Responsive design
- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no libraries)

## 🧠 How It Works

- Uses JavaScript’s `Date` object to fetch the current time.
- Translates seconds, minutes, and hours into degrees.
- Applies the calculated rotation to the corresponding clock hands using CSS transforms.
